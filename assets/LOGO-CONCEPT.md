# Bardacle Logo Concept

## Design Direction

**Theme**: Barnacle + Bard (memory keeper) + Crustacean family (OpenClaw heritage)

### Visual Elements

1. **Primary Shape**: Stylized barnacle shell
   - Conical/volcano shape typical of barnacles
   - Segmented plates (like real barnacles)
   - Opening at top

2. **Consciousness Indicator**: 
   - Soft glow or thought bubble emerging from the opening
   - Could contain a small spiral (representing memory/thought)
   - Or a simple dot pattern (like neural activity)

3. **Attachment**: 
   - Small "grip" lines at the base showing it attaches to things
   - Represents how Bardacle attaches to your agent

### Color Palette

**Primary**: 
- Deep ocean teal (#1a535c) - stability, depth
- Warm coral (#ff6b6b) - the glow of awareness

**Secondary**:
- Sand/shell (#f7fff7) - background
- Deep navy (#2c3e50) - text/outlines

### Style Options

**A. Minimal/Geometric**
```

  ╱ ◉  ╲

   ║║║║
```
Simple triangular shell with a glowing center dot.

**B. Friendly/Cartoon**
- Rounded barnacle with a cute face peeking out
- Eyes and maybe a small thought bubble
- More approachable for GitHub/social

**C. Technical/Badge**
- Clean hexagon or circle containing stylized barnacle
- Works well as favicon, app icon
- Professional feel

### Recommended: Option A (Minimal)

For a developer tool, clean and minimal works best:
- Recognizable at small sizes (16x16 favicon)
- Looks good in dark and light mode
- Evokes the concept without being childish
- Easy to reproduce in ASCII for CLI

### ASCII Logo (for terminal/README)

```
    🐚 BARDACLE
   ╱‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾╲
  ╱    ◉     ╲
 ╱____________╲
      ║║║
```

Or simpler:

```
 🐚 bardacle
```

### File Formats Needed

- `logo.svg` - Vector, scalable
- `logo-dark.svg` - For dark backgrounds
- `icon-64.png` - GitHub/social
- `icon-16.png` - Favicon
- `banner.png` - README header (1280x640)

## Generation Options

1. **AI Image Generation**: Use DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion with prompts based on this concept

2. **Manual Design**: Simple enough to create in Figma, Inkscape, or even CSS

3. **Commission**: Find a designer on Fiverr/99designs if we want polish
